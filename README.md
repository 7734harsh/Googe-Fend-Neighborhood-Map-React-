# Assessment: Neighborhood Map (React) 

## Introduction :)
This is the last Project of our Nano Degree Program, and the project was to create a single page application featuring a map of our neighborhood or a neighborhood we would like to visit, adding functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Run the Application
At terminal, check that if you have Node.js installed. If installed, then move to the new cloned directory by using cd command. From inside that new directory, run the following command to install dependencies npm install and after that, start the server with the npm start command in terminal.The Neighborhood Map App will automatically open in the browser

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
